# Zork-game-of-Java
The game I have chosen is “zork”. 
2. 2D array for the pictures. I will make arrays for 2D arrays so the pictures can be motional.
 
3.The game is based on a adventure game include weapons and saving point. which weapons can be saved  and return after the character die. 
 
4.The player will choose one out of the three doors and events will happen after open the door.
 
5 After open the door it includ include monsters, weapons and level ups.
 
6 The battle include 4 options: attack, escape, skill, items. An array for each of them and connected by using ‘index’. 
 
7 The goal of the game is to get out of the dungeon by choosing the right door and kill the monsters behind the door by using skills and weapons then get through the game.
 
8 The order of choosing the door will be unchangeable.(Things behind each door are always the same and only one possibility.)
 
9 One method for each door. Some of the door will be the same (ex. Door 6 will do the same thing as door 2 which returns to door 2 by using void )
